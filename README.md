# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System
An end-to-end Deep Learning system for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with Grad-CAM explainability, served through a modern Streamlit interface.

🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an accurate, transparent, and user-friendly AI system that:

- Automatically classifies MRI images as **Tumor** or **No Tumor**
- Provides visual explainability using **Grad-CAM heatmaps**
- Offers a simple and interactive UI for medical or academic use
- Compares CNN performance with **classical ML model (SVM)** to validate deep learning superiority
- Demonstrates practical deployment using **Streamlit**

📂 Dataset Details
**Dataset:** Brain Tumor MRI Dataset  
**Total images:** ~253  
- Tumor: ~155  
- No Tumor: ~98  

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- Real MRI scans  
- Varying orientations, sizes, and contrast differences  

**Preprocessing:**
- Resize images to **224×224** for CNN  
- Normalization (pixel scaling 0–1)  
- Conversion to NumPy arrays  
- Train-test split  
- For SVM: grayscale, resize to 64×64, flatten + PCA

🧠 Algorithms & Models Used

**1️⃣ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) — Main Model**
- Custom CNN architecture with:
  - Convolution → ReLU → MaxPooling layers  
  - Flatten + Dense layers  
  - Softmax classifier (2 classes)
- Input size: **224×224×3**
- Training:
  - Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy  
  - Optimizer: Adam  
  - Achieved Accuracy: **95–98%**  
- Output: **Tumor / No Tumor + Confidence score**

**2️⃣ Grad-CAM (Explainable AI)**
- Generates heatmaps that show **where the model is focusing**
- Interprets model decisions visually  
- Highlights tumor-suspected regions  
- Only shown when tumor is detected  

**3️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM) — Comparison Model**
- Baseline classical ML model  
- Grayscale + Resize (64×64)  
- PCA for dimensionality reduction  
- SVM (RBF Kernel) for classification  
- Achieved Accuracy: **~74.51%**

**Conclusion:** CNN significantly outperforms SVM due to spatial learning capability.
